# How to run ZZR-SingleNotch.inp

## Basic operations
1. Please make sure all the inp files are in thr same Abaqus directory, for example *D:/temp/*;
2. Open Abaqus CAE and switch to the **Job Module**;
3. Create new job in the Job Manager and change **Source** option to **Input file** and select ZZR-SingleNotch.inp;
4. It takes about 20 minutes to run the whole analysis.


## Change Model Parameters
### Johnson-Cook Plasticity
Open the file Material.inp.

Note the underlined lines represent the progressive failure criterion (Line 2-5) and the Johnson-Cook dynamic failure criterion (Line 16-17), which can be used at the same time. To see the difference, please delete the lines or add ** before the lines for commenting.

The symbol of Johnson-Cook plasticity parameters after each keywords line are listed below.

>*Damage Initiation, criterion=JOHNSON COOK
>$d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, \theta_{melt}, \theta_{transition}, \dot{\epsilon}_0 $


> *Damage Evolution, type=ENERGY, degradation=MULTIPLICATIVE
> 1.,


> *Plastic, hardening=JOHNSON COOK
>  $A, B, n, m, \theta_{melt}, \theta_{transition}$


> *Rate Dependent, type=JOHNSON COOK
>  $C, \dot{\epsilon}_0 $


> *SHEAR FAILURE, TYPE=JOHNSON COOK, ELEMENT DELETION=YES
> $d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5$

*The detailed parameters explanation can be referred to the presentation.*

### Projectile Impact Velocity / Plate Innitial Temperature
Open the file Fields.inp.

To change the innitial velocity of the projectile, change the numbers under ***Initial Conditions, type=VELOCITY** (Line 6-8), which is the velocity component in $x,y,z$ direction respectively and is (0 m/s,-30 m/s,0 m/s) now.

> *Initial Conditions, type=VELOCITY
> _PickedSet18, 1, 0.
> _PickedSet18, 2, -30.
> _PickedSet18, 3, 0.

To change the innitial temperature of the plate, change the number under ***Initial Conditions, type=TEMPERATURE** (Line 3), which is 298 K now.

> *Initial Conditions, type=TEMPERATURE
> _PickedSet27, 298.

### Step Duration
Open the file Step.inp, and change the number after ***Dynamic, Explicit, adiabatic** (Line 3), which is 0.00015 s now.

> *Dynamic, Explicit, adiabatic 
>, 0.00015
